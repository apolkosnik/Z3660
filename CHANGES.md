# Z3660 Changes

##v1.01
 * First public version

##v1.02
 * SCSI SD emulation first steps.
 * The CPLD firmware doesn't implement DMA accesses, so you can't use busmaster Zorro III boards (like the A4091).
Also A4000T and A3000(T) will not work with any SCSI attached unit.
<br>A4000T can boot, but not use the internal SCSI, if you use the A4000D kickstart.

##v1.03 beta 1
 * Fixed some troubles with 8 bit modes and miniterm 12 (copy_rect_nomask).
 * Added pre-alfa version of warp3d.library. There is too much work to be done here... but... I want to show you this... Warning: the addresses are hardcoded and you will need to have Z3 RAM enabled (autoconfigured RTG has to be at $50000000)!!!!
 * I2C measures are now controlled by a state machine. If I2C get stuck, then I2c measures are stopped (and don't affect to general behavior...).
 * Added new commands to console, so you can increment or decrement some "adjustment parameters" like EMU read/write delays, and ethernet nag delay.
 * ZTop app adjustments for different fonts. And now shows the Beta version.
 * As RTG driver has changed, you need to delete your devs:Picasso96Settings and start again with p96prefs... 
 * SCSI stability fixes<br>
 * The kickstart load has been changed in z3660cfg.txt. You firstly declare upto 9 different kickstarts, and finaly you select one of them using a index. Now you can change between kickstarts in Ztop application.
 * Also, it has been implemented the extended kistart load, in the same way than current kickstarts (they load at $00F00000).
 * The reset behavor has also changed:
<br> 1. If you maintain the reset for 4 seconds, then the CPU will cycle between 060, Musashi, UAE and UAEJIT. 
<br> 2. But if you maintain the reset for 8 seconds, then all env files will be deleted (the configuration used will be what you declared in z3660cfg.txt file as default).

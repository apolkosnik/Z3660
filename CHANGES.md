# Z3660 Changes

##v1.01
 * First public version

##v1.02
 * SCSI SD emulation first steps.
 * The CPLD firmware doesn't implement DMA accesses, so you can't use busmaster Zorro III boards (like the A4091).
Also A4000T and A3000(T) will not work with any SCSI attached unit.
<br>A4000T can boot, but not use the internal SCSI, if you use the A4000D kickstart.

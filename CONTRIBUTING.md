# How to contribute

This project started as a one person project, but is open to anyone who wants to contribute their knowledge in both electronics and programming.

(space reserved to talk about the social networks that we will use to develop this project further).

## Testing

I have tested the Z3660 on 2 different A4000s. And someone else has tested the Z3660 on his A4000.
This represents a very short case study...
I need some brave people who want to try this accelerator board.

This is the time to contribute to something that combines the use of a real 060 processors and new technologies based on FPGAs and ARMs. So it's time to use those 060s you bought thinking you could use them in two months, and two years later they're in a box.

And remember, this project is open source and open hardware, so it's both yours and mine, for all Amigans (with A4000 :) ).
I'm sorry, but I can't give free accelerators to anyone, nor do I ask for donations of any kind.
I do this because I've always loved the Amiga and I've always felt like an Amigan... (well no, when I had the zx spectrum I still wasn't an Amigan, hahaha).

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/shanshe/Z3660/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done. Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

## Coding conventions

I am the first one that does not comply strictly with the coding conventions, as you may have noticed, but the idea is to polish the sources until there is a code understandable by all, not only by me.

So I encourage you to make Pull Requests, even if it's just to make the code more readable.
In the tests that I have done (believe me, in two years there is time to do a lot of tests) I have left a lot of dead code. You can even find an open source mpeg video player (not mine) for one of the ARMs. This should be removed from the code, although it never hurts to have it around in case it's needed for something.

In order to optimize for readability (more lines will be added as needed):

   * Indent using three spaces (soft tabs)
   * This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them.
   * Comment your modifications, everyone should know what you are doing.

Thanks,

# SOUND FILES
These are mp3 files with Siri/Alexa voices-like, to be played when you maintain reset more than 4 seconds.
<br>Just copy all these files.
<br>When you maintain reset you will hear, at the HDMI audio output, a voice telling you what is selected in this moment. The 4 files are for "060 CPU", "MUSASHI EMULATION", "UAE EMULATION" and "UAE JIT EMULATION" (in this order).
<br>
<br>Important Note:
<br>
<br>Right now only the "spa" (spanish voice) directory is played (it is hard coded in the ARM sources), so if you want to play the "eng" (english voice) files you should copy them to the "spa" directory.

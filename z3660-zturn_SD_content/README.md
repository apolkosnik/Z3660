# BOOT FILES
Put in this directory the files z3660_scsi.rom and z3660cfg.txt.

z3660_scsi.rom contains the bootrom of SD SCSI emulation, so you need it only if you are going to boot from hdf files.

z3660cfg.txt contains some configuration of the Z3660. It should be very self explanatory.

You can comment out a line with a `#` on the first character of a line. If you use multiple lines with the same configuration, last one config is what will be finally selected.

# A note from Z-turn SD
I have received a SD with every Z-turn I have bought, but they are HC and yes, they are really slow!!! Please use XC SDs.
